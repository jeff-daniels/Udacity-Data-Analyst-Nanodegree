Contains projects needed to complete Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

### Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data  
The first project is analyzing bike rental data.  Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualizations were performed on Bay Area Bike Share data to come up with conclusions about bike usage.

### Statistics  

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. A good intuition for the data was provided and use of statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results was performed.

### Intro to Data Analysis  
The Titanic dataset was investigated using NumPy and Pandas.  The entire data analysis process was completed by first posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.  

 - Project: [Investigate a Data Set](https://github.com/jeff-daniels/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/3-Intro-to-Data-Analysis/Investigate%20a%20Data%20Set.ipynb)

### Data Wrangling
Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
#### Explore and Summarize Data: Wine Quality  
Use R and apply exporatory data analysis to explore The Wine Quality for White Wines dataset created by Paulo Cortez.  This dataset contains quantitative variables such as acidity and density and the qualitative variable of quality as judged by wine experts.  

### Intro to Machine Learning  
#### Identify Fraud from Enron Email  

Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.  


# Data Visualization
## Make Effective Data Visualization
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use d3.js to create the visualization. Work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
